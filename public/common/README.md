# Common Folder

The common folder we can also call it components folder, here we keep all the common HTML files which we will import later into the main pages with JavaScript.

Example: we can have many pages and all pages have the navbar as a common component, so a navbar.html will have only the navbar code and with the .load() function we can append it to the pages.
